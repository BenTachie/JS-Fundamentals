# JavaScript Fundamentals Project

Welcome to the **JavaScript Fundamentals Project** - a structured, hands-on learning journey through core JavaScript programming concepts. This repository contains a series of concise, practical scripts designed to solidify your understanding of JavaScript syntax, logic, and runtime behaviour using only the core language (no frameworks or libraries).


---

## 🚀 Project Purpose

This project was created to:
- Master the building blocks of JavaScript through clean, readable code.
- Understand how JavaScript executes from the command line (Node.js).
- Practice problem-solving with strict constraints — no `var`, no shortcuts.
- Build fluency with real-world JS use cases like loops, conditionals, recursion, and command-line input.

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Explain why JavaScript is powerful for modern development.
- Run JavaScript scripts via Node.js.
- Use `const`, `let`, and avoid `var` intentionally.
- Identify and apply JavaScript data types.
- Use conditionals (`if`, `else`), loops (`for`, `while`), and operators.
- Define and call functions (including recursive ones).
- Understand variable scope.
- Work with command-line arguments via `process.argv`.
- Handle objects and dictionaries.
- Import code from other files (modularity).

| `2-arguments.js` | Prints message based on the number of CLI arguments. |
| `3-value_argument.js` | Prints first CLI argument or “No argument”. |
| `4-concat.js` | Concatenates two CLI arguments into a sentence. |
| `5-to_integer.js` | Converts first CLI argument to integer or prints error. |
| `6-multi_languages_loop.js` | Prints 3 lines using an array and a loop. |
| `7-multi_c.js` | Prints “C is fun” x times using a loop. |
| `8-square.js` | Prints a square of size `x` using `X` characters. |
| `9-add.js` | Adds two CLI arguments using a defined function. |
| `10-factorial.js` | Computes factorial of a number recursively. |

🌟 A Final Thought
"The journey to mastering JavaScript doesn't begin with frameworks — it starts with understanding the fundamentals."

Happy coding! 🧠💻
